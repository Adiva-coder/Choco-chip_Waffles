Step-by-step recipe to make delicious waffles :

- Grease the waffle maker using butter or vegetable oil and pre-heat it according to the manufacturing instructions.

- Mix the dry ingredients together with a whisk first along with the choco-chips spread evenly at the top.

- Add in the milk, then the slightly cooled melted butter.

- Add the eggs and stir, just enough to combine the ingredients together. There might be a few lumps in the batter which is ok but the big patches or lumps need to be stirred.

- Pour the batter according to your needs onto the preheated waffle maker and cook according to the instructions or until the steaming stops.

- To make soft waffles, cook for less time and for crispy waffles, cook longer.

- If the steaming has slowed down a lot and you can easily open the waffle iron to remove the waffle without it sticking, it is most likely done.

- Your choco-chip waffle is ready, you can serve this with butter, powdered sugar, syrup or as is.

- Enjoy your meal :) !!
